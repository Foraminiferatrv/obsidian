> Classes are a template for creating objects.

Classes in JS are built on [[Prototype(JS)|prototypes]] but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

Classes are in fact "special [[Functions (JS)|functions]]", and just as you can define [function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) and [function declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function), a class can be defined in two ways: a [class expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class) or a [class declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class).
