>`let` - keyword that binds a value to a [[Variables(Rs)|variable]]

The primary use for the `let` keyword is in `let` statements, which are used to introduce a new set of variables into the current scope, as given by a pattern.

The `mut` keyword can be added after a `let` keyword to make the variable [[Mutability(rs)|mutable]].
