>**Mutability** - is the ability to change something (values, references, etc.)

### `mut`

By default all [[Variables(Rs)|variables]] in Rust are *immutable*. In order to make variable or a pointer the `mut` keyword needs to be added in front of the name of a variable.

``` rust
let mut x = 5;
//
new_edition(&mut immutabook);
```
