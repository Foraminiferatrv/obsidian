The **`Object`** type represents one of [[Data types(JS)]]. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the [`Object()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Object) constructor or the [object initializer / literal syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer).
