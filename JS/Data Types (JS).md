Types in JavaScript are categorized by:
- **Primitives ([[string (JS)|string]], [[number (JS)|number]], [[null(JS)|null]], [[boolean(JS)|boolean]], [[undefined(JS)|undefined]], [[symbol(JS)|symbol]])**: these are immutable data types. They are not objects, don't have methods and they are stored in memory by value.
- **Non-Primitives ([[Functions (JS)|functions]], [[Array(JS)|arrays]] and [[Object(JS)|objects]])**: these are mutable data types. They are objects and they are stored in [[Memory(JS)|memory]] by reference. ^bc81c3
