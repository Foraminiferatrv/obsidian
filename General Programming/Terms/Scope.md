### Lexical scope

>**Lexical scope** is a fundamental concept in programming that determines the accessibility of variables and functions within a program. In simple terms, the lexical scope is the scope of a variable or function based on where it is defined in the source code. The scope is determined by the placement of variables and functions in the code, and it remains the same throughout the execution of the program.
