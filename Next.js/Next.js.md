>Next.js is a [[React]] framework that allows building full stack application.

### Difference between React
- React - is a library for building interactive UIs
- Next.js - is a **framework**  for building full-stack application. It includes tools, libs and conventions for creating front-end and back-end parts of an application. 

One big difference is that Next.js allows to run JavaScript code in [[Node.js]] runtime on the server. The front-end part is bundled and executed in web-browser.

- Next.js uses [[Server Side Rendering|SSR]] *(Server Side Rendering)*.

>In Next.js all component **by default**  are [[Server Side Rendering|server-side components]]
